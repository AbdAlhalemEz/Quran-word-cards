## 🧠 Why It Works for Toddlers

Toddlers can memorize words much faster than adults because:  

- 🧩 Their brains are highly adaptable and form new connections quickly  
- 👀 They focus better on simple, engaging stimuli without interference from prior knowledge  
- 🔄 Repetition and play help strengthen memory  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Toddlers may recognize or repeat a word quickly, but solid memorization still requires multiple exposures. Short, fun sessions work best!
