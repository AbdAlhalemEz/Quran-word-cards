Quran Word Cards

Quran Word Cards is a fun and interactive web app designed to help toddlers (under 3 years) start learning Quranic words in a simple and engaging way. The app uses colorful cards with Arabic words, transliteration, and English meanings to make learning enjoyable for little kids.

Why It Works for Toddlers

Toddlers can memorize words much faster than adults because:

Their brains are highly adaptable and form new connections quickly.

They focus better on simple, engaging stimuli without interference from prior knowledge.

Repetition and play help strengthen memory.

⚠️ Note: Toddlers may recognize or repeat a word quickly, but solid memorization still requires multiple exposures. Short, fun sessions work best!
